**<span style="color:red">Update:</span>** I am on leave at Apple, where I am leading the Knowledge Platform - ML team. After that, I will be joining the Department of Computer Science at ETH Zurich.

I am an Assistant Proferssor at UW-Madison. My lab works on the foundations of **structured intelligence systems**. We are focusing on the following threads: 

* <b>Software 2.0 for Data Quality:</b> We are exploring the fundamental connections between data cleaning and machine learning. The [HoloClean](http://www.holoclean.io) project introduced Machine Learning to the problem of data cleaning: We showed how to model data cleaning as statistical learning problem, how attention-based mechanisms and self-supervised learning can automate data cleaning and introduced multiple theoretical results on how to deal with noisy/dirty data. More recently we are exploring the synergies between data cleaning and machine learning deployments in the [Picket](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04730) project. This [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2upFBZsMN4) at the Stanford MLsys Seminar provides an overview.

* <b>Deep Learning over Billion-scale Structured Data:</b> We are developing a system to enable the use of modern, deep learning models over billion-edge structured data dramatically easier. We have started with the [Marius](https://marius-project.org) project that focuses on a key bottleneck in the development of machine learning systems over large-scale graph data: data movement during training. Marius addresses this bottleneck with a novel data flow architecture that maximizes resource utilization of the entire memory hierarchy (including disk, CPU, and GPU memory). Marius is under active development and available as an [open-source project](https://github.com/marius-team/marius). You can learn more about Marius from our [OSDI`21 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP9kUuipK1A&t=17s).

I've also had the please to cofound Inductiv, a company around HoloClean, that is now <span style="color:red">part of Apple.</span>
