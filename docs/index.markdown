**<span style="color:red">Update:</span>** I am currently on leave at Apple, where I lead the Knowledge Platform - Graph ML team. I will also be joining the Department of [Computer Science at ETH Zurich](https://inf.ethz.ch) where I will be part of the [Systems Group](https://systems.ethz.ch). 

My lab focuses on the foundations of **structured intelligence systems**:

* <b>Software 2.0 for Data Quality:</b> We are exploring the fundamental connections between data cleaning and machine learning. The [HoloClean](http://www.holoclean.io) project introduced Machine Learning to the problem of data cleaning: We showed how to model data cleaning as statistical learning problem, how attention-based mechanisms and self-supervised learning can automate data cleaning and introduced multiple theoretical results on how to deal with noisy/dirty data. More recently we are exploring the synergies between data cleaning and machine learning deployments in the [Picket](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04730) project. This [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2upFBZsMN4) at the Stanford MLsys Seminar provides an overview.

* <b>Neural Relational Engines over Billion-scale Data:</b> We are developing a new paradigm of systems to make the use of <b>deep learning models over billion-scale structured data easier, faster, and cheaper</b>. We have started with the [Marius](https://marius-project.org) project that focuses on a key bottleneck in the development of machine learning systems over large-scale graph data: data movement during training. Marius addresses this bottleneck with a novel data flow architecture that maximizes resource utilization of the entire memory hierarchy (including disk, CPU, and GPU memory). Marius is under active development and available as an [open-source project](https://github.com/marius-team/marius). You can learn more about Marius from our recent [OSDI`21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP9kUuipK1A&t=17s) and [MLOpsWorld](/assets/marius_mlops.pdf) talks.

<b>I am always looking for good students!</b> If interested in working on the above topics (at a PhD or PostDoc level) please reach out at theo.rekatsinas [at] inf.ethz.ch.

Previously, I was an Assistant Proferssor at UW-Madison and a member of the Database Group. I've also had the pleasure to cofound Inductiv, a company around HoloClean, that is now part of Apple.
